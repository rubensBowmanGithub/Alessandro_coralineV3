# Rebuilds an entire module (i.e. stagelib) and reinstalls to dist/target
# Assumes a local build has already been done and lives in dist/target/streamsets-datacollector-*
# Deletes the individual modules' target directories, as well as the entire coraline-libs subdirectory
# within the dist/target installation.  Then, runs a new mvn install invocation (always with all-libs profile)
# that includes all these modules, as well as modules they depend on (ex: container, etc.), as well as dist
# (so they are actually reinstalled properly). Does not touch the UI or any data/config files in the locally
# installed version.
#
# If the first argument is -noam then the -am (also make dependents) option to Maven is omitted, meaning that
# only this module and dist itself will be rebuilt.
#
# Example invocations
# Rebuild and reinstall all CDH 6.x stagelibs, including all dependent modules
#   dev-support/reinstall-coraline-module.sh $(ls -d cdh_6_*-lib)
# Rebuild only one stagelib, but not all dependent modules
#   dev-support/reinstall-coraline-module.sh -noam cdh_spark_2_1_r1-lib
